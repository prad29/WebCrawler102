# WebCrawler102
This is an updated and more dynamic version of WebCrawler101



This is a dynamic version of the main webcrawler I created before. It goes to a webpage, crawls every necessary piece of information 
and as well as the required links.
The links given as arguments can be modified to crawl your desired webpage.
For the moment it crawls the refurbished deal area of E-bay. This was used for educational purposes only and not intended towards violation of E-Bay's terms and agreements.

Enjoy ;)
